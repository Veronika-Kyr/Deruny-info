            Deruny is one of the most popular and tasty traditional Ukrainian dishes. The name of this dish connected
            with a way they are cooked. The most important secret is that you should shred, grate potatoes into pretty
            small pieces. To shred is to “derty” – “дерти” in Ukrainian language, so from this verb “derty” (to shred)
            they become <strong> DERUNY)))</strong>
            Very often deruny are served with fried mushrooms, cheese, sour cream etc.
            There is even the Deruny Fest, which is organized in <strong>Korosten city</strong> every year. Everybody
            may taste different
            variants of this dish from every region of Ukraine. It's really fun there. F.e., in 2010 it was cooked the
            biggest piece of deruny. Its weight was 140 kg. <br>
